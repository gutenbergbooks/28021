<h2>THE SALE OF LITTLE HARRY.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
Come read my book good boys and girls<br />
That live on freedom's ground,<br />
With pleasant homes, and parents dear,<br />
And blithesome playmates round;<br />
And you will learn a woeful tale,<br />
Which a good woman told,<br />
About the poor black negro race,<br />
How they are bought and sold.<br />
<br />
Within our own America<br />
Where these bad deeds are done,<br />
A father and a mother lived<br />
Who had a little son;<br />
As slaves, they worked for two rich men,<br />
Whose fields were fair and wide&mdash;<br />
But Harry was their only joy,<br />
They had no child beside.<br />
<br />
Now Harry's hair was thick with curls<br />
And softly bright his eyes,<br />
And he could play such funny tricks<br />
And look so wondrous wise,<br />
That all about the rich man's house<br />
Were pleased to see him play,<br />
Till a wicked trader buying slaves<br />
Came there one winter day.<br />

<div class='poem2'>
Oh children dear, 'twas sad to hear,<br />
That for the trader's gold,<br />
To that hard-hearted evil man<br />
Her own sweet boy was sold.<br /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<div class='poem'>
<br />
The trader and the rich man sat<br />
Together, at their wine,<br />
When in poor simple Harry slipped<br />
In hopes of something fine.<br />
He shewed them how the dandy danced,<br />
And how old Cudjoe walked,<br />
Till loud they laughed and gave him grapes,<br />
And then in whispers talked.<br />
<br />
The young child knew not what they said,<br />
But at the open door<br />
Eliza, his poor mother, stood,<br />
With heart all sick and sore.<br />
Oh children dear, 'twas sad to hear,<br />
That for the trader's gold,<br />
To that hard-hearted evil man<br />
Her own sweet boy was sold.<br />
<br />
And he would take him far away,<br />
To where the cotton grew,<br />
And sell him for a slave to men<br />
More hard and wicked too.<br />
She knew that none would heed his woe,<br />
His want, or sickness there,<br />
Nor ever would she see his face,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Or hear his evening prayer.<br />
<br />
So when the house was all asleep,<br />
And when the stars were bright,<br />
She took her Harry in her arms,<br />
And fled through that cold night:&mdash;<br />
Away through bitter frost and snow<br />
Did that poor mother flee;<br />
And how she fared, and what befell,<br />
Read on, and you shall see.<br />
</div>


<p>Before setting out, Eliza took a piece of paper
and a pencil, and wrote hastily the following note
to her kind mistress, who had tried in vain to save
little Harry from being sold:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh missus! dear missus! don't think me ungrateful;
don't think hard of me. I am going to
try to save my boy; you will not blame me! God
bless and reward you for all your kindness!"</p>

<p>Hastily folding and directing this, she went to a
drawer and made up a little package of clothing for
her boy, which she tied firmly round her waist;
and so fond is a mother's remembrance, that even
in the terrors of that hour she did not forget to
put up in the little package one or two of his favourite
toys.</p>

<p>On the bed lay her slumbering boy, his long
curls falling negligently around his unconscious
face, his rosy mouth half open, his little fat hands
thrown out over the bed-clothes, and a smile spread
like a sunbeam over his whole face. "Poor boy!
poor fellow!" said Eliza, "they have sold you, but
your mother will save you yet."</p>

<p>It was some trouble to arouse the little sleeper;
but after some effort he sat up, and began playing
with his wooden bird, while his mother was putting
on her bonnet and shawl.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, mother?" said he, as
she drew near the bed with his little coat and cap.</p>

<p>His mother drew near, and looked so earnestly
into his eyes, that he at once divined that something
unusual was the matter.</p>

<p>"Hush, Harry," she said; "mustn't speak loud,
or they will hear us. A wicked man was coming
to take little Harry away from his mother, and
carry him 'way off in the dark; but mother won't
let him&mdash;she's going to put on her little boy's cap
and coat, and run off with him, so the ugly man
can't catch him."</p>

<p>Saying these words, she had tied and buttoned
on the child's simple outfit, and taking him in her
arms, she whispered to him to be very still; and,
opening the door, she glided noiselessly out.</p>

<p>It was a sparkling, frosty, starlight night, and
the mother wrapped the shawl close round her
child, as, perfectly quiet with terror, he clung round
her neck.</p>

<p>At first the novelty and alarm kept him waking;
but after they had gone a considerable way, poor
Harry said, as he found himself sinking to sleep&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother I don't need to keep awake, do I?"</p>

<p>"No, my darling; sleep now, if you want to."</p>

<p>"But, mother, if I do get asleep, you won't let
him get me?"</p>

<p>"No! so may God help me!" said his mother
with a paler cheek, and a brighter light in her large
dark eyes.</p>

<p>"You're <i>sure</i>, an't you, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sure</i>!" said the mother, in a voice that
startled herself; for it seemed to her to come from a
spirit within, that was no part of her; and the boy
dropped his little weary head on her shoulder, and
was soon asleep.</p>

<p>When morning came, as poor Harry complained
of hunger and thirst, she sat down behind a large
rock, which hid them from the road, and gave him
a breakfast out of her little package. The boy
wondered and grieved that she could not eat, and
when putting his arms round her neck he tried to
force some of his cake into her mouth, it seemed
to her that the rising in her throat would choke
her.</p>

<p>"No, no, Harry, darling! mother can't eat till
you are safe! We must go on&mdash;on&mdash;till we come
to the river." And she hurried again into the
road and proceeded on her journey.</p>

<p>When the trader came to take away Harry, he
was in a great rage, because neither the boy nor
his mother could be found. The master who sold
him was also very angry, and ordered two of his
negroes, called Andy and Sam, to bring out two of
the swiftest horses, and help the trader to pursue
Eliza, and take Harry from her. Andy and Sam
did not like that work, but being slaves, they dare
not disobey. However, they did what they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to detain the trader; for, pretending to be in great
haste, they squalled for this and that, and frightened
the horses, till they ran off over hedges and ditches,
with Andy and Sam after them, laughing till their
sides ached as soon as they got out of sight. The
trader all the while stood cursing and swearing, like
a wicked man as he was.</p>

<p>When the horses were caught, they were so tired
with their race, that he was fain to let them stay
and rest till dinner-time. But when dinner-time
came, Chloe the cook, of whom you will hear more
in the course of the story, spilled one dish,
kept another long in baking; and so the trader
did not get his dinner till it was late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The horses were brought out at last, and he set
off with Sam and Andy in pursuit of poor Harry
and his mother. They had gone a great way by
this time, and Eliza's feet were sore with walking
all the night and day, and Harry was ready to lie
down and sleep on the snow. As the sun was setting,
they came in sight of the great river Ohio.
There was no bridge over it. People crossed in
boats in the summer time, and in winter on the
thick ice, with which it was always covered. Now
it was the month of February. The ice had broken,
because spring was near. The river was swollen
over all its banks, and no boatman would venture
on it. There was a little inn hard by, and there
poor Eliza hoped to get a little rest for herself and
Harry, who was now fast asleep in her arms. She
had just sat down by the fire, when, who should
ride into the yard but the trader and his guides.
The swift horses had brought them much quicker
than she and Harry could walk, but the weary
mother would not lose her child. She darted out
with him that moment, and the verses will tell you
by what means she escaped.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>ELIZA CROSSING THE RIVER</h2>


<div class='poem'>
From her resting-place by the trader chased,<br />
Through the winter evening cold,<br />
Eliza came with her boy at last,<br />
Where a broad deep river rolled.<br />
<br />
Great blocks of the floating ice were there,<br />
And the water's roar was wild,<br />
But the cruel trader's step was near,<br />
Who would take her only child.<br />
<br />
Poor Harry clung around her neck,<br />
But a word he could not say,<br />
For his very heart was faint with fear,<br />
And with flying all that day.<br />
<br />
Her arms about the boy grew tight,<br />
With a loving clasp, and brave;<br />
"Hold fast! Hold fast, now, Harry dear,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>And it may be God will save."<br />
<br />
From the river's bank to the floating ice<br />
She took a sudden bound,<br />
And the great block swayed beneath her feet<br />
With a dull and heavy sound.<br />
<br />
So over the roaring rushing flood,<br />
From block to block she sprang,<br />
And ever her cry for God's good help<br />
Above the waters rang.<br />
<br />
And God did hear that mother's cry,<br />
For never an ice-block sank;<br />
While the cruel trader and his men<br />
Stood wondering on the bank.<br />
<br />
A good man saw on the farther side,<br />
And gave her his helping hand;<br />
So poor Eliza, with her boy,<br />
Stood safe upon the land.<br />
<br />
A blessing on that good man's arm,<br />
On his house, and field, and store;<br />
May he never want a friendly hand<br />
To help him to the shore!<br />
<br />
A blessing on all that make such haste,<br />
Whatever their hands can do!<br />
For they that succour the sore distressed,<br />
Our Lord will help them too.<br />
</div>


<p>When the two negroes saw Eliza's escape, they
began to laugh and cheer; on which the trader
chased them with his horsewhip, cursing and swearing
as usual. But he could not get over the river,
and went in very bad temper to spend that night at
the little inn, determined to get a boat, if possible,
and catch Harry in the morning. The man who
had helped Eliza up the river's bank, showed her a
pretty white house at some distance, where a kind
gentleman and his wife lived. The dark night had
fallen, the tea-cups were on the table, and the fires
were bright in kitchen and parlour, when the poor
mother, all wet and weary, her feet cut by the sharp
ice (for she had lost her shoes in the river), walked
in, with Harry still in her arms. Before she could
ask for shelter, she dropped down fainting on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
floor. The good people of the house thought she
was dead, and raised a terrible alarm. Mr. and
Mrs. Bird ran into the kitchen to see what had
happened. They were good, kind people, and great
in that place, for Mr. Bird was a member of the
American Parliament. He kept slaves himself,
and tried to think it was no sin. He had even been
trying that very night, in conversation with his wife,
to defend a law lately passed, which forbade any one
to give shelter to poor runaway slaves. But Mrs. Bird
would listen to no defence of such a law, and said,
"It is a shameful, wicked, and abominable law, and
I'll break it for one the first time I have a chance,
and I hope I shall have a chance too. I know nothing
about politics, but I can read my Bible, and there
I see that I must feed the hungry, clothe the naked,
and comfort the desolate; and that Bible I mean to
follow. No, no, John, said she, you may talk all
night, but you would not do what you say. Would
you now turn away a poor, shivering, hungry
creature from your door because he was a runaway?
Would you, now?"</p>

<p>Now, if the truth must be told, Mr. Bird was a
very kind man, and could not in his heart give a
very decided reply to his wife; and it was just at
this moment that poor Eliza and little Harry came
to his door. As we said, Mr. and Mrs. Bird ran
to the kitchen to see what had happened. They
found poor Eliza just recovering from her faint.
She stared wildly round her for a moment, and then
sprang to her feet, saying, "Oh! my Harry! have
you got him?" The boy at this ran to her, and
put his arms round her neck. "Oh! he's here, he's
here!" she exclaimed. And then she cried wildly
to Mrs. Bird, "O, ma'am, do protect us, don't let
them get him!"</p>

<p>"Nobody shall hurt you here, poor woman,"
said Mrs. Bird. "You are safe; don't be afraid."</p>

<p>"God bless you," said the woman, covering her
face and sobbing, while poor little Harry, seeing her
crying, tried to get into her lap.</p>

<p>With many gentle and womanly offices which no
one knew better how to render than Mrs. Bird, the
poor woman was rendered more calm. A temporary
bed was provided for her near the fire; and
after a short time, Eliza, faint and weary with her
long journey, fell into a heavy slumber, with little
Harry soundly sleeping on her arm.</p>

<p>"I wonder who and what she is," said Mr. Bird,
when he had gone back to the parlour with his
wife.</p>

<p>"When she wakes and feels a little rested, we
shall see," said Mrs. Bird, who began to busy herself
with her knitting.</p>

<p>Mr. Bird took up a newspaper, and pretended to
be reading it, but it was not long before he turned
to his wife and said, "I say, wife, couldn't she
wear one of your gowns; and there's that old cloak
that you keep on purpose to put over me when I
take my afternoon's nap, you might give her that;
she needs clothes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bird simply replied, "We'll see;" but a
quiet smile passed over her face as she remembered
the conversation they had had together that very
night before Eliza and little Harry came to their
door.</p>

<p>After an hour or two, Eliza awoke, and Mr. and
Mrs. Bird again went to the kitchen. As they
entered, poor Eliza lifted her dark eyes, and fixed
them on Mrs. Bird, with such a forlorn and imploring
expression, that the tears came into the kind-hearted
woman's eyes.</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid of anything; we are
friends here, poor woman! Tell me where you
came from, and what you want?" said she.</p>

<p>"I came from Kentucky," said poor Eliza.</p>

<p>"And what induced you to run away?" said
Mrs. Bird.</p>

<p>The woman looked up with a keen, scrutinising
glance, and it did not escape her that Mrs. Bird
was dressed in deep mourning.</p>

<p>"Ma'am," she said, suddenly, "have you ever
lost a child?"</p>

<p>The question was unexpected, and it was a
thrust on a new wound; for it was only a month
since a darling child of the family had been laid in
the grave.</p>

<p>Mr. Bird turned round and walked to the window,
and Mrs. Bird burst into tears; but, recovering
her voice, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that? I have lost a little
one."</p>

<p>"Then you will feel for me. I have lost two,
one after another&mdash;left them buried there when I
came away; and I had only this one left. I never
slept a night without him; he was all I had. He
was my comfort and pride day and night; and,
ma'am, they were going to take him away from me&mdash;to
<i>sell</i> him&mdash;a baby that had never been away
from his mother in his life! I couldn't stand it,
ma'am. I knew I never should be good for anything
if they did; and when I knew the papers
were signed and he was sold, I took him and came
off in the night, and they chased me&mdash;the man that
bought him and some of master's folks, and they
were coming down right behind me, and I heard
them&mdash;I jumped right on to the ice, and how I got
across I don't know, but first I knew a man was
helping me up the bank."</p>

<p>"Crossed on the ice?" cried every one present.</p>

<p>"Yes," said poor Eliza, slowly. "I did, God
helping me. I crossed on the ice, for they were
behind me&mdash;right behind&mdash;and there was no other
way!"</p>

<p>All around were affected to tears by Eliza's
story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bird himself, to hide his feelings, had to
turn away, and became particularly busy in wiping
his spectacle-glasses and blowing his nose.</p>

<p>After a short pause, Mrs. Bird asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And where do you mean to go to, my poor
woman?"</p>

<p>"To Canada if I only knew where that was. Is
it very far off ma'am?" said she, looking up with a
simple and confiding air to Mrs. Bird's face.</p>

<p>"Poor woman," said Mrs. Bird, "it is much
further off than you think; but we will try to think
what can be done for you. Here Dinah," said she
to one of the servants, "make her up a bed in your
own room close by the kitchen, and I'll think what
to do for her in the morning. Meanwhile, never
fear poor woman, put your trust in God, He will
protect you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bird and her husband re-entered the parlour.
She sat down in her little rocking chair before the
fire, swinging it thoughtfully to and fro. Mr. Bird
strode up and down the room, grumbling to himself.
At length, striding up to his wife, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, wife, she'll have to get away from here
this very night. That trader fellow will be down
after her early to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"To-night," said Mrs. Bird, "how is it possible&mdash;and
where to?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know pretty well where to," said Mr.
Bird, beginning to put on his boots. "I know
a place where she would be safe enough, but the
plague of the thing is, nobody could drive a carriage
there to-night but me. The creek has to be crossed
twice, and the second crossing is quite dangerous,
unless one know it as I do. But never mind. I'll
take her over myself. There is no help for it. I
could not bear to see the poor woman caught."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, dear John," said the
wife, laying her white hand on his&mdash;"Could I ever
have loved you had I not known you better than
you do yourself?"</p>

<p>Off Mr. Bird set to see about the carriage, but at
the door he stopped for a moment, and then coming
back, he said, with a quivering voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mary, I don't know how you'd feel about it,
but there's the drawer full of things&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;poor
little Henry's." So saying, he turned quickly on
his heel, and shut the door after him.</p>

<p>His wife opened the little bedroom door adjoining
her room, and taking the candle, set it down
on the top of a bureau there; then from a small
recess she took a key, and put it thoughtfully in
the lock of a drawer, and made a sudden pause,
while two boys, who, boy-like, had followed close
on her heels, stood looking, with silent, significant
glances, at their mother. And oh! mother that
reads this, has there never been in your house a
drawer, or a closet, the opening of which has been
to you like the opening again of a little grave?
Ah! happy mother that you are, if it has not
been so!</p>

<p>Mrs. Bird slowly opened the drawer. There
were little coats of many a form and pattern, piles
of aprons, and rows of small stockings; and even a
pair of little shoes, worn and rubbed at the toes,
were peeping from the folds of a paper. There was
a toy horse and waggon, a top, a ball&mdash;memorials
gathered with many a tear and many a heartbreak!
She sat down by the drawer, and leaning her head
on her hands over it, wept till the tears fell through
her fingers into the drawer; then suddenly raising
her head, she began, with nervous haste, selecting
the plainest and most substantial articles, and
gathering them into a bundle.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said one of the boys, gently touching
her arm, "are you going to give away those
things?"</p>

<p>"My dear boys," she said, softly and earnestly,
"if our dear, loving, little Henry looks down from
heaven, he would be glad to have us do this. I
could not find it in my heart to give them away to
any common person&mdash;to anybody that was happy;
but I give them to a mother more heart-broken
and sorrowful than I am; and I hope God will
send his blessings with them!"</p>

<p>Mr. Bird returned about twelve o'clock with the
carriage. "Mary," said he, coming in with his
overcoat in his hand, you must wake her up now.
"We must be off." Soon arrayed in a cloak, bonnet,
and shawl that had belonged to her benefactress,
poor Eliza appeared at the door with her child in
her arms. When she got seated in the carriage,
she fixed her large dark eyes on Mrs. Bird's face,
and seemed going to speak. Her lips moved, but
there was no sound; pointing upward with a look
never to be forgotten, she fell back in her seat and
covered her face. The door was shut, and the
carriage drove on.</p>

<p>It was not long before they arrived at the place
where Mr. Bird thought they would be safe from
the cruel trader. It was a village about seven
miles off, consisting of neat houses, with orchards
and meadows about them.</p>

<p>They all belonged to Quakers, a sect of Christians
whom foolish people laugh at, because they think it
right to wear broad-brimmed hats, and odd old-fashioned
bonnets; but they do many good and charitable
things, especially for the poor negroes, and
one of them took Harry and his mother in.</p>

<p>I cannot tell all the kindness the Quaker and his
family did to them, giving Harry such good things,
and watching lest the trader should come that way;
but the greatest joy of all was, one evening, when
a tall strong man, called Phineas Fletcher, who was
a Quaker, and a great traveller, guided to the
village Harry's poor father, George. His master
was going to sell him too, and he had run away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and searched everywhere for his wife and child, to
take them with him to Canada, which you know
belongs to England. Oh what a happy meeting
that was between George, Eliza, and little Harry.</p>

<p>But they could not remain long with the kind
Quakers. Their cruel pursuers had found out
where they were hid, so they had all to set out
again together. This time they were guided by
the brave-hearted Phineas Fletcher, and hoped to
reach Canada in safety. But their pursuers overtook
them, and they had to run to the rocks to
defend themselves, as the verses will tell.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE DEFENCE.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
See Harry's poor father, with pistol in hand,<br />
How bravely he takes on the steep rock his stand,<br />
Over rivers, and forests, and towns he has passed,<br />
And found his Eliza and Harry at last.<br />
<br />
The kind Quaker folks that wear drab, brown, and gray,<br />
To the wanderers gave shelter and bread on their way,<br />
Their warm clothes were given them, their waggon was lent,<br />
And the strong-armed Phineas along with them went.<br />
<br />
Their hope was to journey to Canada's shore,<br />
Where the trader or master could reach them no more;<br />
For the English flag floats there, o'er land and o'er sea,<br />
And they knew in its shadow the negro was free.<br />
<br />
But far is their way through the slave-dealing land,<br />
And now on their track comes the trader's fierce band;<br />
So for refuge and rest to the rocks they have run,<br />
And the father will fight for his wife and his son.<br />
<br />
He fires on the first up the steep rock that springs,<br />
But the trader comes on, shouting all wicked things,<br />
Till Phineas right over the crag flings him clear,<br />
Saying, "Friend, in my mind thou hast no business here."<br />
<br />
Then off go the traders to find them more men,<br />
And off go the friends in their waggon again;<br />
But don't you wish well to the good man for life,<br />
Who would fight for his freedom, his child, and his wife?<br /><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>After this, George and Eliza, with their little
Harry, journeyed on, never stopping, except at the
house of another kind friend, to disguise themselves
before going on board the steamboat, which at last
brought them safe to Canada.</p>

<h2>ARRIVAL IN THE LAND OF FREEDOM.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
Look on the travellers kneeling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In thankful gladness, here,</span><br />
As the boat that brought them o'er the lake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Goes steaming from the pier.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis Harry, like a girl disguised,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His mother, like a boy,</span><br />
But the father kneels beside them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their hearts are full of joy.</span><br />

No man can buy or sell them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No trader chase them more,</span><br />
The land of freedom has been gained,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The good Canadian shore.</span><br />
<br />
And they are strangers on the soil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As poor as poor can be,</span><br />
But the English flag above them floats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They know that they are free.</span><br />
</div>

<p>George got employment in a factory, and as he
was active and clever in his work, he soon earned
enough to take a pretty little house, where they all
lived together. Harry grew older, and went to
school, where he was a good boy, and never forgot
how God had preserved him from the wicked trader,
and what his poor mother had suffered to bring
him away. His father, George, though he worked
all day, was learning too from all sorts of good
books, which he used to read by the fire in the
evenings. He was ever thinking of the poor
heathen kings in Africa, and the negroes they sold
for slaves. So at last, when he had learned a great
deal, he determined to become a missionary; and,
with his wife and family, he embarked for Africa,
where he still labours, teaching the poor negroes
the glad tidings of the gospel.</p>


<h3><br />WHO UNCLE TOM WAS.</h3>

<p>Now I must tell you something about Uncle
Tom, from whom this book is named. He was a
negro man, as black as jet, and a slave, belonging
to Mr. Shelby, the rich man who at first owned
Eliza and Harry. Mr. Shelby had a great estate,
and many slaves to cultivate it, but they all loved
and respected Tom, for he was a good Christian,
and kind to everybody, on which account they used
all to call him Uncle. Tom's master was kind to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
cabin or cottage hard by the rich man's house; it
his slaves, and especially to Tom, because he was
honest and careful with his property. Tom had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was built of logs cut from great trees; there was a
garden in front, with beautiful flowers and strawberries
in it; and climbing plants, so common in
our country, twined along the walls. Tom had also
a wife as black as himself; her name was Chloe, and
she cooked for the Shelbys. You will remember
how late she kept the trader's dinner when he wanted
to pursue Eliza. They had two little sons, with very
black faces and curly heads, and a little black baby
just beginning to walk. Tom and his family were
very happy in that cabin; the poor negroes used to
gather there to hear Tom sing hymns and pray,
for, as I said, he was a pious man, and the slaves
had no other church to go to, for many people in
America will not let negroes worship God with
them. Mr. Shelby's son, a very clever boy, who
had gained many prizes at school, liked Tom too,
and used to come teach him to read and write in
the evenings, and Tom had great hopes of being
able to read the Bible at last. As Chloe was a cook
she always contrived to have ready something very
nice for Mr. George when he came to teach her
goodman, and George would stand with one eye on
Tom's copy, and another on the cake she prepared,
while the boys and the baby played about them.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No trader chase them more,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The good Canadian shore.</span><br />
</div>

<p>But all those pleasant days came to an end. Mr.
Shelby lost his money, and got in debt to a man
who dealt in slaves; for that debt he sold little
Harry to him, and the rest of it was paid with
poor Tom. Think what sad news that was for the
cabin!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>TOM AND HIS WIFE HAVE HEARD THAT<br />
HE IS SOLD.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
The work of the winter day is o'er,<br />
But Tom and his wife are weeping sore<br />
Beside the hearth, where you can't forget<br />
How the cakes were baked, and the copy set.<br />
<br />
Oh, never again will Tom be taught!<br />
From his master, by wicked trader bought;<br />
And he will carry poor Tom next day,<br />
From children, and wife, and home away.<br />
<br />
His home&mdash;It was low of roof and wall,<br />
But there had been room and love for all,<br />
The peace that waits on contented days,<br />
The voice of prayer and the hymn of praise.<br />
<br />
And Tom himself, he is black of skin,<br />
But, children, his soul is fair within,<br />
His life is good and his heart is brave,<br />
And yet they have sold him as a slave.<br /><br />

Oh well may their poor tired mother weep!<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
The fire light shows on the lowly bed,<br />
Each dusky face, and each curly head<br />
Of his little children, sound asleep;<br />
Oh well may their poor tired mother weep!<br />
<br />
Now Tom is trying to soothe her woe:<br />
"Dear Chloe 'tis best that I should go,<br />
Our babes and you will live safely here,<br />
And I may be far, but God is near."<br />
<br />
"Yet think of me, love, when I am gone,<br />
And the days of the pleasant spring come on.<br />
Don't grieve, dear wife"&mdash;and his tears fell fast.<br />
"You know we will meet in heaven at last."<br />
</div>


<p>Tom might have fled away, as Eliza did with
Harry, but he took pity on Mr. Shelby for being
in debt to the trader, and also feared that if he
fled, his wife and children would be sold to pay it.
Poor Chloe wept sore, and so did the boys, and all
the negroes on the estate were very sorry to part
with him. George Shelby was from home when
Tom was sold, and knew nothing about the matter.
But he returned that very day, and the moment
he learned that Tom was gone, he saddled his horse
and rode after him. When he came up to the
waggon he sprang into it, and throwing his arms
round Tom's neck, began sobbing and scolding
most violently.</p>

<p>"I declare it's a shame! I don't care what they
say, any of them. It's a nasty mean shame! If I
was a man, they shouldn't do it," said George.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mas'r George! this does me good!" said
Tom. "I couldn't bear to go off without seein' ye!
It does me real good, ye can't tell!" Here Tom
made some movement of his feet, and George's eyes
fell on the fetters.</p>

<p>"What a shame!" he exclaimed, lifting his hands.
"I'll knock that old fellow down&mdash;I will!"</p>

<p>"No, you won't, Mas'r George; and you must not
talk so loud. It won't help me any, to anger him."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't, then, for your sake; but only
to think of it&mdash;isn't it a shame? They never sent
for me, nor sent me any word, and, if it hadn't
been for Tom Lincoln, I shouldn't have heard it.
I tell you, I blew them up well, all of them, at
home."</p>

<p>"That wasn't right, I'm feared, Mas'r George."</p>

<p>"Can't help it! I say it's a shame! Look here,
Uncle Tom," said he, turning his back to the rest
of the party, and speaking in a mysterious tone,
"<i>I've brought you my dollar!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't think o' takin' it, Mas'r George,
no ways in the world," said Tom, quite moved.</p>

<p>"But you shall take it," said George. "Look
here; I told Aunt Chloe I'd do it, and she advised
me just to make a hole in it, and put a string
through, so you could hang it round your neck,
and keep it out of sight, else this mean scamp
would take it away. I tell ye, Tom, I want to
blow him up! it would do me good."</p>

<p>"No, don't, Mas'r George, for it won't do <i>me</i>
any good."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't, for your sake," said George,
busily tying his dollar round Tom's neck; "but
there, now, button your coat tight over it, and
keep it, and remember, every time you see it, that
I'll come down after you, and bring you back.
Aunt Chloe and I have been talking about it. I told
her not to fear; I'll see to it, and I'll tease father's
life out if he don't do it."</p>

<p>"O, Mas'r George, ye mustn't talk so about
your father! You must be a good boy; remember
how many hearts is set on ye. Always keep close
to yer mother. Don't be gettin' into them foolish
ways boys has of gettin' too big to mind their
mothers. Tell ye what, Mas'r George, the Lord
gives good many things twice over; but he don't
give ye a mother but once. Ye'll never see sich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
another woman, Mas'r George, if ye live to be a
hundred years old. So, now, you hold on to her,
and grow up, and be a comfort to her, thar's my
own good boy&mdash;you will, now, won't ye?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, Uncle Tom," said George, seriously.</p>

<p>"And be careful of yer speaking, Mas'r George.
Young boys, when they come to your age, is wilful,
sometimes&mdash;it's natur they should be. But
real gentlemen, such as I hopes you'll be, never lets
fall no words that isn't respectful to thar parents.
Ye an't offended, Mas'r George?"</p>

<p>"No indeed, Uncle Tom; you always did give
me good advice."</p>

<p>"I's older, ye know," said Tom, stroking the
boy's fine curly head with his large, strong hand,
but speaking in a voice as tender as a woman's&mdash;"and
I sees all that's bound up in you. O, Mas'r
George, you has everything&mdash;larnin', privileges,
readin', writin'&mdash;and you'll grow up to be a great,
learned, good man, and all the people on the place,
and your mother and father'll be so proud on ye!
Be a good mas'r, like yer father; and be a Christian,
like yer mother. Remember yer Creator in the
days o' yer youth, Mas'r George. And now, Good-bye,
Mas'r George," said Tom, looking fondly and
admiringly at him. "God Almighty bless you!"
Away George went, and Tom looked, till the clatter
of his horse's heels died away, the last sound or
sight of his home.</p>

<p>When the trader was disappointed in catching
Harry, he put handcuffs on poor Tom to prevent
his escape, and took him away in a waggon to a
town, where he bought more slaves&mdash;children from
their mothers, and husbands from their wives&mdash;some
of them as black as Tom, and some nearly white,
like Harry and his mother. Then he put them all
on board of a steamboat going down the great river
Mississippi. You will see on the map that it is one
of the largest rivers in America. There are many
towns on its banks, and steamboats go from one to
another carrying goods and passengers; and the
trader seeing that Tom was quiet and peaceable,
took off the handcuffs, and allowed him to go about
the steamboat helping the sailors, for Tom would
help anybody. There were many people on board
besides the negroes, and among them a rich gentleman
called Mr. St. Clair. He was returning home
from a visit to his relations, who lived in New
England, and had with him his little daughter Eva,
and his cousin Miss Feely. Eva had long yellow
curls, and a fair, pretty face; better than that, she
had the fear of God and the love of all goodness in
her heart. Always cheerful, meek, and kindly,
everybody loved Eva St. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'clair'">Clair</ins>, especially her father,
for she was his only daughter. Tom saw her play
about the steamboat, for they were days and nights
on the voyage. Eva used to come close and look at
him, when he sat thinking of Chloe and the children.
The little one was shy, notwithstanding all
her busy interest in everything going on, and it was
not easy to tame her. But at last Tom and she got
on quite confidential terms.</p>

<p>"What's little missy's name?" said Tom at last,
when he thought matters were ripe to push such an
inquiry.</p>

<p>"Evangeline St. Clair," said the little one,
"though papa and everybody else call me Eva.
Now, what's your name?"</p>

<p>"My name's Tom; the little children used to
call me Uncle Tom, away back thar in Kentucky."</p>

<p>"Then, I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because,
you see, I like you," said Eva. "So, Uncle Tom,
where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Miss Eva."</p>

<p>"Don't know?" said Eva.</p>

<p>"No. I am going to be sold to somebody. I
don't know who."</p>

<p>"My papa can buy you," said Eva, quickly;
"and if he buys you, you will have good times. I
mean to ask him to, this very day."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my little lady," said Tom.</p>

<p>The boat here stopped at a small landing to take
in wood, and Eva, hearing her father's voice,
bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went
forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon
was busy among the hands.</p>

<p>Eva and her father were standing together by
the railings to see the boat start from the landing-place;
the wheel had made two or three revolutions
in the water, when, by some sudden movement,
the little one suddenly lost her balance, and fell
sheer over the side of the boat, into the water.
Her father, scarce knowing what he did, was
plunging in after her, but was held back by some
behind him, who saw that more efficient aid had
followed his child.</p>

<p>Tom was standing just under her on the lower
deck as she fell. He saw her strike the water and
sink, and was after her in a moment. A broad-chested,
strong-armed fellow, it was nothing for
him to keep afloat in the water, till, in a moment or
two, the child rose to the surface, and he caught
her in his arms, and, swimming with her to the
boat-side, handed her up, all dripping, to the grasp
of hundreds of hands, which, as if they had all
belonged to one man, were stretched eagerly out to
receive her. A few moments more, and her father
bore her, dripping and senseless, to the ladies'
cabin, where she soon recovered.</p>

<p>Her father was much rejoiced, and Eva took
such a liking for Tom, that she would not rest till
the rich Mr. St. Clair had bought him from the
trader; and the girl hoped that she would one day
get her father coaxed to set him free. From that
day Tom and Eva were great friends. The steamer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
brought them safely to New Orleans. The trader
took all his slaves away to sell them in that town;
and Tom was taken to Mr. St. Clair's fine house,
where you see him and Eva. You may also see
the doings of little Topsy, a poor negro child,
whom Mr. St. Clair bought, and made a present of
to his cousin Miss Feely.</p>

<h2>TOPSY AT THE LOOKING GLASS.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
See little Topsy at the glass quite gay,<br />
Her mistress has forgot the keys to-day,<br />
So she has rummaged every drawer, and dressed<br />
Herself out in Miss Feely's very best.<br />
<br />
Mark where she stands! the shawl of gorgeous red<br />
Wound like a Turk's great turban round her head;<br />
A finer shawl far trailing on the floor,<br />
Just shews her bare black elbows, and no more.<br />
<br />
With what an air she flaunts the ivory fan,<br />
And tries to step as stately as she can,<br />
Mincing fine words to her own shadow, "Dear!<br />
How very ungenteel the folks are here!"<br />
<br />
But while that shadow only Topsy sees,<br />
Back comes the careful lady for her keys,<br />
And finds her in the grandeur all arrayed&mdash;<br />
Poor Topsy will be punished, I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
Now it is wrong, as every reader knows,<br />
To rummage people's drawers, and wear their clothes;<br />
But Topsy is a negro child, you see,<br />
Who never learned to read like you and me.<br />
<br />
A child whom bad men from her mother sold,<br />
Whom a harsh mistress used to cuff and scold,<br />
Whom no one taught or cared for all her days,<br />
No wonder that the girl had naughty ways.<br /><br /></div>

And so they are found out, it comes to pass,<br />
Just like poor Topsy at the looking-glass.<br />

<h2>TOPSY BRINGING FLOWERS TO EVA.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
Poor Topsy, trying to be kind,<br />
Has brought a bunch of garden flowers<br />
To Eva, when she lies reclined<br />
Through the bright summer's sultry hours.<br />
<br />
For sickness hangs on Eva now,<br />
She can no longer run or play,<br />
Her cheek is pale, her voice is low,<br />
And there she lies the livelong day.<br />
<br />
Yet Eva does not fear to die,<br />
She knows a better home remains<br />
For her, beyond the great blue sky,<br />
Where comes no sickness, tears, or pains.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Oh mother dear, let Topsy stay,"<br />
Says Eva in her gentle mood,<br />
"She brought such pretty flowers to-day,<br />
Indeed she's trying to be good."<br /><br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
For in her happier days of health<br />
She read and prized her Bible true,<br />
Above this poor world's pride or wealth,<br />
And loved her blessed Saviour too.<br />
<br />
And she like him was kind to all,<br />
And pity on poor Topsy had,<br />
Because the rest would scold and call<br />
Her names, for being black and bad.<br />
<br />
So Eva strove to make her good,<br />
And told her, of all tales the best,<br />
How Christ came down to shed his blood,<br />
That sinners might be saved and blest.<br />
<br />
Poor Topsy tried to understand&mdash;<br />
None ever taught her so before&mdash;<br />
And brought the sweet flowers in her hand,&mdash;<br />
The negro girl could do no more.<br />
<br />
But Eva's proud mamma comes in<br />
With scornful look and frown severe,<br />
She cries, "begone, you nasty thing!<br />
In all the world what brings you here?"<br />
<br />
"Oh mother dear, let Topsy stay,"<br />
Says Eva in her gentle mood,<br />
"She brought such pretty flowers to-day,<br />
Indeed she's trying to be good."<br />
<br />
"I'm going fast, where there will be<br />
No difference, but in sins forgiven,<br />
And mother it might chance that we<br />
Would bring poor Topsy flowers in heaven."<br /><br /></div>

Oh, swift and sad were the tears that fell,<br />

<h2>THE DEATH OF EVA.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
There is peace on Eva's wasted brow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a soft light in her eye;</span><br />
But her father's heart grows hopeless now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he knows that she must die.</span><br />
<br />
Yet the thought is kind and the trust is true,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As she takes him by the hand,&mdash;</span><br />
Dear father I will look for you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the light of God's own land.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh let them cut the long, long curls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That flow about my head,</span><br />
And let our poor kind negroes come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a moment round my bed.</span><br />
<br />
"They have smoothed and stroked it many a day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In their kindly sport, and care,</span><br />
And it may be they will think of me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they see that curling hair."</span><br />
<br />
The negroes loved her, young and old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a fond and deep regard,</span><br />
For Eva's look was never sour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her words were never hard.</span><br />
<br />
And her old nurse by the bedside stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sore sobbing in her woe,</span><br />
That so many sinners here should stay,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the good and young should go.</span><br />
<br />
"Dear nurse," said Eva, "I go home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the happiest home of all;</span><br />
Where never an evil thing will come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never a tear will fall.</span><br />
<br />
"And I will hope each one to see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That blessed home within;</span><br />
Where Christ himself will set us free<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the bonds of death and sin."</span><br />
<br />
Oh, swift and sad were the tears that fell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As her gifts among them passed,</span><br />
And Tom, he got the first fair curl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Topsy got the last.</span><br />
<br />
But first and last alike were given,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With some words of love and prayer;</span><br />
And it may be, hearts were helped to heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the links of that soft hair.</span><br />
</div>

<p>When Eva was dead and buried, Tom missed
her sore, but he knew it was the will of God, and
tried to comfort his master. Mr. St. Clair intended
to set him free for Eva's sake. He was a kind
man, but given to delay, and one day a wicked
man stabbed him in a coffee-house, when he was
trying to settle a quarrel. Mrs. St. Clair was a
proud, hard-hearted woman, who cared for nobody
but herself. She sold all the negroes, and Tom
among them, to a cruel cotton planter, called
Legree, and you shall see how he behaved.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>LEGREE STRIKING TOM.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
Tom's good wife Chloe, far at home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his boys so blythe and black,</span><br />
Are all working hard, in hopes to win<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dollars, to buy him back.</span><br />
<br />
And George, who taught him long ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has many a pleasant plan,</span><br />
To pay his price, and set him free.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he comes to be a man.</span><br />
<br />
But little does that wicked man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his angry madness, know,</span><br />
That God himself will take account<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of each cruel word and blow.</span><br />
<br />
And children dear, who see him here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At night and morning pray,</span><br />
That you may never have aught like this<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laid up for the judgment day!</span><br />
</div>

<p>By the time all these things happened, George
Shelby had grown up; but when he came to buy
back Tom, the pious, kindly negro, had been so
ill-treated by that cruel planter, because he tried to
save the other slaves from his evil temper, that he
lay dying in an old shed; and there was no law to
punish the wicked planter, because Tom was
black.</p>

<p>When George entered the shed where Tom lay,
he felt his head giddy and his heart sick.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" said he, kneeling down by him.
"Uncle Tom, my poor, poor old friend!"</p>

<p>Something in the voice penetrated to the ear of
the dying. He smiled, and said&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Jesus can make a dying bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">Feel soft as downy pillows are."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Tears fell from the young man's eyes as he bent
over his poor friend.</p>

<p>"O, dear Uncle Tom! do wake&mdash;do speak once
more! Look up. Here's Mas'r George&mdash;your own
little Mas'r George. Don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"Mas'r George!" said Tom, opening his eyes,
and speaking in a feeble voice&mdash;"Mas'r George!"
He looked bewildered.</p>

<p>Slowly the idea seemed to fill his soul; and the
vacant eye became fixed and brightened, the whole
face lighted up, the hard hands clasped, and tears
ran down the cheeks.</p>

<p>"Bless the Lord' it is&mdash;it is&mdash;it's all I wanted!
They haven't forgot me. It warms my soul; it
does my old heart good! Now I shall die content!
Bless the Lord, O my soul!"</p>

<p>He began to draw his breath with long, deep
aspirations; and his broad chest rose and fell
heavily. The expression of his face was that of a
conqueror.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who shall separate us from the love of
Christ?" he said, in a voice that contended with
mortal weakness; and with a smile he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Beyond the boundaries of the plantation George
had noticed a dry, sandy knoll, shaded by a few
trees; there they made a grave for poor Tom.</p>

<p>"Shall we take off the cloak, mas'r?" said the
negroes, when the grave was ready.</p>

<p>"No, no; bury it with him. It's all I can give
you now, poor Tom, and you shall have it."</p>

<p>They laid him in; and the men shovelled away
silently. They banked it up, and laid green turf
over it.</p>

<p>"You may go, boys," said George, slipping a
quarter dollar into the hand of each. They lingered
about, however.</p>

<p>"If young mas'r would please buy us," said one.</p>

<p>"We'd serve him so faithful!" said the other.
"Do, mas'r, buy us, please!"</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I can't," said George, with difficulty,
motioning them off; "it's impossible!"</p>

<p>The poor fellows looked dejected, and walked off
in silence.</p>

<p>"Witness, eternal God," said George, kneeling
on the grave of his poor friend&mdash;"O, witness that,
from this hour, I will do <i>what one man can</i> to drive
out this curse of slavery from my land!"</p>

<p>There is no monument to mark the last resting-place
of poor Tom. He needs none. His Lord
knows where he lies, and will raise him up immortal,
to appear with Him when He shall appear in
his glory.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

Dry the tears for holy Eva!<br />
With the bless&eacute;d angels leave her;<br />
Of the form so sweet and fair,<br />
Give to earth the tender care.<br />
For the golden locks of Eva,<br />
Let the sunny south land give her<br />
Flow'ry pillow of repose,<br />
Orange bloom and budding rose,<br />
Orange bloom and budding rose.<br />
<br />
All is light and peace with Eva;<br />
There the darkness cometh never;<br />
Tears are wiped, and fetters fall,<br />
And the Lord is all in all.<br />
Weep no more for happy Eva;<br />
Wrong and sin no more shall grieve her,<br />
Care, and pain, and weariness,<br />
Lost in love so measureless!<br />
<br />
Gentle Eva, loving Eva,<br />
Child confessor, true believer,<br />
Listener at the Master's knee,<br />
"Suffer such to come to me."<br />
O for faith like thine, sweet Eva,<br />
Lighting all the solemn river,<br />
And the blessing of the poor,<br />
Wafting to the heavenly shore.<br />
